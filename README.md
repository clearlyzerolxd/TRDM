# Two-stage Diffusion Rainfall Forecasting Model

Deep neural networks have made great achieve-
ments in rainfall prediction.However, the current forecasting
methods have certain limitations, such as issues with blurry
generated images and incorrect spatial positioning. To overcome
these challenges, In this work, we propose a Two-Stage Dif-
fusion Rainfall Prediction Model (TSDR) aimed at improving
the accuracy of long-term rainfall forecasts and addressing
the imbalance in performance between temporal and spatial
modeling in deep models. In comparison to other methods, we
have divided the rainfall prediction task into two stages. In
essence, the primary objective of the first stage is to capture
robust temporal information while preserving spatial information
under low-resolution conditions. The task of the second stage
is to reconstruct the low-resolution images generated in the
first stage into high-resolution images.Our model demonstrates
robust predictive capabilities on both the MRMS dataset and the
Swedish radar dataset, outperforming methods.
